# About Goof

  Goof is a C standard library that aims to do away with the legacy garbage of
  ISO C and POSIX.  Goof is built from the ground up with the past left in the
  past and the present and future as its only concerns.  This library attempts
  to bring safety, modernity, and most importantly, common sense to C.

# Links

  The goof project is hosted on sourcehut [1], this is where you can find the
  main git repository along with our TODO and mailing lists.  If you are not a
  fan of the sourcehut interface there is a cgit mirror [2] of the repository.

# Contributing

  Contributions to the project are done via the goof-develop mailing list [1].
  This is made easy with git-format-patch(1) and git-send-email(1), but if you
  are not familiar with sending patches by email there is an excelent resource
  here [2] that you can check out.

  There are a few important things you should know before contributing:

   - We use tup(1) as our build system, but it may complain about unsupported
     syntax.  If this is the case you should build tup from source [3].
   - Do not attempt to submit a .gitignore file, those are automatically
     generated by tup.

  It may also be convenient to set the goof-develop mailing list to be the
  default "to" address:

    $ git config sendemail.to "~tdmm/goof-develop@lists.sr.ht"
